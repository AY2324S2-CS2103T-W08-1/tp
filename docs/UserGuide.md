Welcome to HireHub! HireHub is a **desktop app for managing candidates, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Within HireHub, recruiters can easily manage their candidates, jobs and job applications. If you can type fast, HireHub can get your candidate management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps!

This guide will help you set up HireHub and learn the various commands to manage your recruiting needs. For the detail-oriented, it also contains a comprehensive list of commands and their formats. Check out the Quick Start and Command Summary if you are in a hurry.

### Introduction to HireHub

HireHub contains three lists which you can use commands on: Candidates, Jobs and Applications.

![Ui](images/UiEdited.png)

Candidates represent job applicants who might apply or have applied for one or more jobs. They each have a name, phone, email and country, and optionally a comment and multiple tags to distinguish them. Each email must be distinct.

Jobs represent job openings which you can recruit candidates for. Each job has a title, description and vacancy. Vacancy represents the maximum amount of candidates you can recruit for each job. Below the vacancy, there is
no restriction for which candidate can apply for which job. Each title must be distinct.

Applications represent the job applications made by a candidate towards a job. Thus, each application is associated with a candidate (via their email) and a job (via its title). These must be distinct. When a candidate applies, they will go through an interview process and eventually be accepted or rejected, and the status of an application represents this progress.

Each command is a command word followed by a sequence of parameters, e.g. `add n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com c/HK p/61234567 t/Internal` will add a candidate named John Doe to the list. Type a command into the **Command Box**, then press Enter to execute it. You may need to confirm by entering Y or N, if the command deletes data. Output will be shown in the **Output Box**.

Using commands, you can `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `search` and `list` (all entries) of candidates. All of theese commands have equivalents for the Jobs and Applications list, for example `add_job` and `add_app`. (However, to edit an application you can only use status.)

Other commands allow you to tag, delete tags and comment on candidates (`tag`, `delete_tag`, `comment`), clear candidates and applications (`clear`), get candidates by index (`get`) and find the remaining vacancy for a job (`slots_left`).

Finally, enter `help` to view this guide or `exit` to close HireHub.

Go to Features for a more in-depth explanation of commands and parameters.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. If you are using Windows, open the command prompt application. If you are using Mac, open the Terminal application. Then, enter `java -â€”version` and press Enter. If you have Java `11` or above installed, you should see `java xx.y.zz`, where `xx` is `11` or bigger, e.g. `java 17.0.10`. If not, go to this [website](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) to install the correct java version.

2. Download `hirehub.jar` of our latest release, located under "v1.4" under "assets", from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to a folder on your computer. This folder will be used as the _home folder_ for your HireHub.

4. Navigate to the folder containing `hirehub.jar`.
   
5. Type `java -jar hirehub.jar` and press enter to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Now that HireHub is running, you can use commands to add or modify data. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com c/HK p/61234567 t/Internal` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.<br>

* These are the constraints for each of the parameters (this applies to all commands):

| Parameter       | Prefix | Format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **NAME**        | n/     | Cannot be blank, and only alphanumeric characters and spaces are allowed. In particular, special characters such as `/` and `-` and non-English characters (e.g. Chinese characters) are not allowed. This would be part of the planned improvements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **PHONE**       | p/     | Cannot be blank and must adhere to the following constraints: <br><br> 1. International phone numbers should contain a country code in front (+ followed by 1 to 3 digits), then a space, followed by a combination of digits, spaces, parentheses or hyphens with at least 3 digits. <br><br> 2. If country code is omitted, it must be a valid Singapore phone number. It must start with 3, 6, 8 or 9 and must be in the following formats: `XXXXYYYY`, `XXXX-YYYY` or `XXXX YYYY`. <br><br>3. Other than the above constraints, there is no other validation to check if a country code is valid. Furthermore, given a country code, there is no phone validation specific to the country code. This would be part of the planned improvements. |
| **EMAIL**       | e/     | Must be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints: <br><br> 1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters. <br><br> 2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. The domain name must: <br><br> 2a. end with a domain label at least 2 characters long <br> 2b. have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters <br> 2c. have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.                                                   |
| **COUNTRY**     | c/     | Must be a valid ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 code which can be found from https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/. It is case-sensitive and must be in ALL CAPITALS. Alternatively, you can refer to the [appendix](#appendix-country-codes) for the exact ISO code to use for each country. Note that the value for country field shown on the UI is the English display name equivalent of the ISO code for user convenience, and what is actually stored in the backend is the ISO code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **TAG**         | t/     | Cannot be blank (except in edit command), and only alphanumeric characters with no whitespace are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

* These are the primary key (i.e. no 2 items may have the same value of this parameter) of candidates, jobs and applications respectively:
    * **Candidates**: EMAIL
    * **Jobs**: TITLE
    * **Applications**: (EMAIL, TITLE) - either EMAIL or TITLE can be the same, as long as both are not the same.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Applications involving the job to edit will be updated to involve the edited job.
* Editing of the vacancy of a job will fail if the edited vacancy is less than the current number of applications to the job with `OFFERED` status.

---
### Adding a comment on a candidate: `comment`

HireHub data are saved automatically as JSON files `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`, `[JAR file location]/data/jobs.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/applications.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing those data files.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data files makes their format invalid, HireHub will discard all data and start with empty data files at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the files before editing them.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause HireHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data files only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data files it creates with the files that contain the data of your previous HireHub home folder.

**Q**: What is the difference between `edit` and `tag`?<br>
**A**: `edit` will overwrite any current tags with new tags, while `tag` will append the new tags to the current ones. For example, suppose that John is candidate 1 with tags `Internal` and `Waitlist`. `edit 1 t/QuantResearcher` will change John's tags to just `QuantResearcher`, while `tag t/QuantResearcher` will change John's tags to `Internal`, `Waitlist` and `QuantResearcher`.

**Q**: Why can't I add/edit a candidate/job respectively?<br>
**A**: Check the email/title of the candidate/job again. After add/edit operation, no 2 candidates can have the same email (not name), and no 2 jobs can have the same title.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
